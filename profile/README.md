# Qilo Coop

**Qilo** is a cooperative of people building software for the good of people and the planet.  
We design and maintain tools, systems, and digital infrastructures that empower communities, support ethical technology, and create long-term value beyond profit.

## What We Do
- Build open, resilient software systems  
- Support mission-driven and public-good projects  
- Share knowledge, practices, and reusable components  
- Collaborate across engineering, design, research, and governance  

## Principles
- **Cooperation over competition**  
- **Transparency over opacity**  
- **Long-term stewardship over short-term gain**  
- **Simplicity, clarity, and integrity in our work**  

## Projects
This organization hosts the collective work of Qilo members — libraries, tools, documentation, and experiments aligned with our mission.  
Each project includes its own README describing goals, usage, and contribution guidelines.
